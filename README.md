# Turtl.Bio

[Live Deployment](https://turtl-bio-p8aqj.ondigitalocean.app/)

**A structured workspace for interpreting FDA guidance and regulatory precedent early.**

Turtl.Bio helps preclinical biotech teams preparing their first IND understand **what FDA guidance and prior precedent actually mean for their specific product**. The focus is on interpretation and applicability, not automation.

---

## What Our Platform Is

- A **decision-support workspace** for regulatory interpretation
- Designed for **early-stage, preclinical biotech teams**
- Helps teams reason about:

  - which guidance applies
  - under what conditions
  - based on product modality and precedent

Turtl.Bio structures FDA guidance and historical precedent so teams can make **earlier, clearer applicability decisions** during development.

---

## What Our Project is Not

- A submission generator
- A drafting or filing automation tool
- A replacement for regulatory consultants
- A generic “chat with your PDFs” system

The goal is to **reduce ambiguity earlier**, not automate downstream regulatory work.

---

## Problem Being Addressed

From interviews with early-stage biotech teams:

- FDA guidance is high-level and conditional
- Applicability depends on modality, mechanism, and precedent
- Relevant precedent is fragmented across PDFs, spreadsheets, and notes
- Interpretation becomes a bottleneck, leading to delays and reliance on consultants

The challenge isn’t access to information, it’s **interpreting it in context**.

---

## Current Focus

This repository represents an early-stage exploration of:

- UI patterns for regulatory interpretation
- Structuring guidance and precedent into interpretable components
- Using LLMs (e.g., Gemini) to support extraction and reasoning
- Evaluating how structured representations reduce uncertainty

We are intentionally prioritizing **clarity, correctness, and trust** over automation.

---

## Open Questions

We are actively testing:

- Whether teams adopt a dedicated interpretation workspace
- Whether structuring guidance + precedent reduces uncertainty
- How generalizable interpretation patterns are across product types

These questions guide short-term experiments and iteration.

## Project Status

**Early / Experimental**

Expect rapid iteration and changes as we validate assumptions through continued user discovery and prototyping.
